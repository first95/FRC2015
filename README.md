Code used for our 2015 robot, Lada Ada Lovelace

FRC Team 95 is a robotics team participating in the First Robotics Competition.
FRC allows teams to reuse code from previous years as long as they make the source available to other teams so that they may use it as well.
Team 95 is a small team, meaning that our code can sometimes be developed hastily. If you want any assistance understanding or repurposing the code we present here, please don't hesitate to send email to one of our programmers.

If you do use or learn from our code, we would love to know about it! Send us a message about what parts you found helpful, and how you used them!
